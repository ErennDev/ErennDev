You can create public repositories for an open source project. When creating your public repository, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others. For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created Open Source Guides that will help you foster a healthy open source community by recommending best practices for creating and maintaining repositories for your open source project.
You can also take a free GitHub Skills course on maintaining open source communities.
You can also add community health files to your repositories, to set guidelines on how to contribute, keep your repositories safe, and much more. For more information, see "Creating a default community health file."
You can store a variety of projects in GitHub repositories, including open source projects. With open source projects, you can share code to make better, more reliable software. You can use repositories to collaborate with others and track your work. For more information, see "About repositories." To learn more about open source projects, visit OpenSource.org.
